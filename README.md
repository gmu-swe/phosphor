Phosphor: Dynamic Taint Tracking for the JVM
========


Phosphor is a system for performing dynamic taint analysis in the JVM, on commodity JVMs (e.g. Oracle's HotSpot or OpenJDK's IcedTea). This repository contains the source for Phosphor. For more information about how Phosphor works and what it could be useful for, please refer to our [OOPSLA 2014 paper](http://jonbell.net/publications/phosphor), [ISSTA 2015 Tool Demo ](http://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1601) or email [Jonathan Bell](mailto:jbell@cs.columbia.edu). José Cambronero also maintains a [series of examples on using Phosphor](https://github.com/josepablocam/phosphor-examples/).

Note - for those interested in reproducing our OOPSLA 2014 experiments, please find a [VM Image with all relevant files here](http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A182689), and a [README with instructions for doing so here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dmebj6k8izams6p/artifact-63-phosphor.pdf?dl=0).


Running
-------
Phosphor works by modifying your application's bytecode to perform data flow tracking. To be complete, Phosphor also modifies the bytecode of JRE-provided classes, too. The first step to using Phosphor is generating an instrumented version of your runtime environment. We have tested Phosphor with versions 7 and 8 of both Oracle's HotSpot JVM and OpenJDK's IcedTea JVM.

The instrumenter takes two primary arguments: first a path containing the classes to instrument, and then a destination for the instrumented classes. You can also specify to track taint tags through control flow, to use objects as tags (instead of integers), or to automatically perform taint marking in particular methods using the various options as shown by invoking Phosphor with the "-help" option.


```
usage: java -jar phosphor.jar [OPTIONS] [input] [output]
 -controlTrack                  Enable taint tracking through control flow
 -help                          print this message
 -multiTaint                    Support for 2^32 tags instead of just 32
 -withoutDataTrack              Disable taint tracking through data flow
                                (on by default)
```
Phosphor now should be configured to correctly run JUnit tests (with taint tracking) in most environments (Mac + Linux... sorry Windows!). Running `mvn verify` should cause Phosphor to generate several different instrumented JRE's (for multitaint use, int-tag taint use, and control track use) into the project's `target` directory, then run unit tests in that JRE that are automatically tracked. You take a look at the test cases to see some example usage. Test cases that end in `IntTagITCase` are executed with Phosphor configured for integer tags, tests that end in `ObjTagITCase` are executed with Phosphor configured for object tags (multi tainting), and `ImplicitITCase` tests run in the control tracking mode.
 
We'll assume that in all of the code examples below, we're in the same directory (which has a copy of Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar, which you generated by downloading Phosphor, and running `mvn package`), and that the JRE is located here: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/jre` (modify this path in the commands below to match your environment).

Then, to instrument the JRE we'll run:
`java -jar Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/jre jre-inst`

After you do this, make sure to chmod +x the binaries in the new folder, e.g. `chmod +x jre-inst/bin/*`

The next step is to instrument the code which you would like to track. This time when you run the instrumenter, pass your entire (compiled) code base to Phosphor for instrumentation, and specify an output folder for that.

We can now run the instrumented code using our instrumented JRE, as such:
`JAVA_HOME=jre-inst/ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java  -Xbootclasspath/a:Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar -javaagent:Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar -cp path-to-instrumented-code your.main.class`

Note: It is not 100% necessary to instrument your application/library code in advance - the javaagent will detect any uninstrumented class files as they are being loaded into the JVM and instrument them as necessary. If you want to do this, then you may want to add the flag `-javaagent:Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar=cacheDir=someCacheFolder` and Phosphor will cache the generated files in `someCacheFolder` so they aren't regenerated every run. If you take a look at the execution of Phosphor's JUnit tests, you'll notice that this is how they are instrumented. It's always necessary to instrument the JRE in advance though for bootstrapping.

New 2/27/19: You can no longer specify auto taint methods (what were sources/sinks/taint through methods) for the static instrumenter. Instead, ALL autotaint instrumentation happens via the java agent (this makes it possible to detect child-classes of auto taint classes). You can specify the files to the java agent using the syntax `-javaagent:Phosphor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar=taintSources={taintSourceFile},taintSinks={taintSinksFile},taintThrough={taintThroughFile}`

Interacting with Phosphor
-----
Phosphor exposes a simple API to allow to marking data with tags, and to retrieve those tags. Key functionality is implemented in two different classes, one for interacting with integer taint tags (``edu.columbia.cs.psl.phosphor.runtime.Tainter``), and one for interacting with object tags (used for the multi-taint mode: (``edu.columbia.cs.psl.phosphor.runtime.MultiTainter``)). To get or set the taint tag of a primitive type, developers call the taintedX or getTaint(X) method (replacing X with each of the primitive types, e.g. taintedByte, etc.).
Ignore the methods ending with the suffix $$PHOSPHOR, they are used internally.
To get or set the taint tag of an object, developers first cast that object to the interface TaintedWithIntTag or TaintedWithObjTag (Phosphor changes all classes to implement this interface), and use the get and set methods.

In the case of integer tags, developers can determine if a variable is derived from a particular tainted source by checking the bit mask of that variable's tag (since tags are combined by bitwise OR'ing them).
In the case of multi-tainting, developers can determine if a variable is derived from a particular tainted source by examining the dependencies of that variable's tag.

You *can* detaint variables with Phosphor - to do so, simply use the `Tainter` or `MultiTainter` interface (as appropriate) to set the taint on a value to `0` (or `null`).

Building
------
Phosphor is a maven project. You can generate the jar with a simple `mvn package`. You can run the tests with `mvn verify` (which also generates the jar). Phosphor requires Java >= 8 to build and run its tests - but can still be used with Java 7 (there are now tests included for Phosphor's functionality with lambdas). If you are making changes to Phosphor and running the tests, you will want to make sure that Phosphor regenerates the instrumented JRE between test runs (because you are changing the instrumentation process). To do so, simply do `mvn clean verify` instead. If you would like to develop Phosphor in eclipse, use `mvn eclipse:eclipse` to generate eclipse project files, then import the project into Eclipse.

Notes on control tracking
-----
Please note that the control tracking functionality can impose SIGNIFICANT overhead (we've observed > 10x slowdown) depending on the structure of the code you are instrumenting and the amount of tainted data flowing around. This is incredibly un-optimized at this point. This also can make it difficult to apply Phosphor with control tracking to very large methods (since it causes them to grow beyond the maximum size permitted). Nonetheless, we have had great success applying it in various projects --- it works fine on the JDK (perhaps a few internal classes will be too large, but they were not needed in our workloads) and on projects like Tomcat. There are quite a few paths to improving this functionality. If you are interested in helping, please contact us.
